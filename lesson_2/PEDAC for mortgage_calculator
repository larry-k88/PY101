Problem:    Build a mortgage calculator to determine monthly payments
            Input - loan amount, APR, loan duration
            Output - monthly payments with units

Examples/Test Cases:    Loan amount = £12,000        
                        APR = 7%
                        Loan Duration = 5 years
                        Monthly payments = £237.61

Data:                   input() x 3
                        Assign to 3 variables
                        Arithmetic operators
                        print()                         

Algorithm:  

    Pseudocode

        Ask user for 3 numbers
        Assign variables to the inputs
        Perform calculation
        Print in 

    Formal pseudocode

        START
        GET loan_value
        GET apr
        GET loan_duration
        SET x3
        Convert to correct units/types
        Perform the calculation
        PRINT the result
        END
