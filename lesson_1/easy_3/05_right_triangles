'''
Write a function that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument and
prints a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse
of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one
end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the
upper-right.

Problem:    Function takes a positive integer and prints that number 
            of lines each with increasing number of *
            The total characters on each line will be the integer
            Input - 1x positive integer
            Output - 9 strings
            Requirements:
                number of lines = integer
                RH triangle needs to be as shown

Examples:   triangle(5)

                *
               **
              ***
             ****
            *****

            triangle(9)
                    *
                   **
                  ***
                 ****
                *****
               ******
              *******
             ********
            *********

Data:       for loop

                
Algorithm:  START
            READ number
            FOR i in range(number):
                print(number-i * ' ' + (i * '*'))           
            END
