'''
Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks"
for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and
place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a
result.

Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an
adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.

Problem:    Take user inputs for 4 variables and then print out a 3
            sentences using those inputs
            Input - 4x user strings
            Output - 3 strings
            Requirements:
                inputs should be case-insensitive
                verb tenses need to match the sentence

Examples:   Enter a noun: dog
            Enter a verb: walk
            Enter an adjective: blue
            Enter an adverb: quickly

            Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
            The blue dog walks quickly over the lazy dog.
            The dog quickly walks up to Joe's blue turtle.

Data:       input()
            f-strings

                
Algorithm:  START
            GET 4x inputs
            SET 4x variables (casefold)
            PRINT f-strings
            END
