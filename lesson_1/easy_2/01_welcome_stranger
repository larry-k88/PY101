'''
Create a function that takes 2 arguments, a list and a dictionary.
The list will contain 2 or more elements that, when joined with spaces,
will produce a person's name.
The dictionary will contain two keys, "title" and "occupation",
and the appropriate values. Your function should return a greeting
that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

Problem:    Take a list and dictionary (which has 2 keys) and pass them 
            into the function
            The elements in the list need to be joined together with a space
            The output will also reference the values in the dictionary
            Input - 1x list, 1x dictionary
            Output - F-string, interpolating the concatenated list and 
                    the dictionary values
            Requirements:
                list input - 2+ values
                dictionary - 2 keys, need to access values for output
        
Examples:   greeting = greetings(
                ["John", "Q", "Doe"],
                {"title": "Master", "occupation": "Plumber"},
            )
            print(greeting)
            # Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.

Data:       join() method to concat the list
            dict.get() to give values
        
Algorithm:  START
            ' '.join(name)
            END
