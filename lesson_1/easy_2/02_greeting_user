Write a program that asks for user's name, then greets the user.
If the user appends a ! to their name,
the computer will yell the greeting (print it using all uppercase).

Problem:    Ask user for their name, check if that name as an ! at the end
            If so, respond in caps, if not, respond by greeting
            Input - User enters string
            Output - f-string, based on input. In caps if ! in the name
            Requirements:
                string input - no validation needed
                        
Examples:   What is your name? Sue
            Hello Sue.

            What is your name? Bob!
            HELLO BOB! WHY ARE WE YELLING?

Data:       input() to get the name
            endswith() to check for !
            if statement (or ternary) to produce output
            str.upper() for first part of greeting 
        
Algorithm:  START
            GET name from user
            SET greet = f'Hello {name}
            IF name endswith !:
                PRINT greet.upper() + WHY ARE WE YELLING
            PRINT greet
            END

def greeting():
    name = input('What is your name? ')
    greet = f'Hello {name}.'
    if name.endswith('!'):
        print (greet.replace('.', '').upper() + ' WHY ARE WE YELLING?')
    else:
        print (greet)
