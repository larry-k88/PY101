Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age.
To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 100,
inclusive.

Problem:    Not a function. Generate a random number
            between 20 - 100, and interpolates it into a f-string
            Requirements:
                20 - 100 inclusive
                Must import random
                        
Examples:   Teddy is 69 years old!

Data:       F-string for the output
            random.randint() to get the number

Algorithm:  START
            SET age = random number generator
            PRINT f-string with {age}
            END
