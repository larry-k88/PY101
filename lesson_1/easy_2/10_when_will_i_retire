'''
Build a program that displays when the user will retire and how many
years she has to work till retirement.

Problem:    Not a function. Input from user (age) and then calculate how
            long until retirement (a second user input)
            Import time to get current year
            Requirements:
                User input must be integer (age and retirement)
                        
Examples:   What is your age? 30
            At what age would you like to retire? 70

            It's 2024. You will retire in 2064.
            You have only 40 years of work to go!

Data:       input x2 (int, not string)
            - operation
            f-string for the output
            

Algorithm:  START
            GET/SET age from user
            GET/SET retirement age from user
            PRINT f-string with {age}
            END
