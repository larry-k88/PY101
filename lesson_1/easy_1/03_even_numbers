Print all even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive,
with each number on a separate line.

Bonus Question: Can you solve the problem by iterating over just
the odd numbers?


Problem:    Take the numbers from 1 to 99 inclusive and print out each
            even number on a new line
            Input - numbers 1-99 
            Output - even numbers from that range
            Requirements:
                Input must be integer values from 1-99
                Output must be even (i.e. % evaluates to 0/falsy)
                No specific guidance on other inputs

Examples:   range(1, 100) - would give the required range
            2, 4, 6 etc. (on different lines)

Data:       range constructor function
            for loop
            if statement
            modulo operator
            print inside the loop

Algorithm:  for the number in the range
                if even (modulo operator):
                    print

Problem:    Take the even numbers from 1 to 99 inclusive and print out
            each number on a new line
            Input - numbers between 1-99
            Output - even numbers from that list/range
            Requirements:
                Input must be integer values from 1-99
                Only even numbers must be iterated over
                No specific guidance on other inputs

Examples:   range(2, 100, 2) - would give the required range of even
            numbers

Data:       range constructor function, with step as '2'
            for loop
                print number

Algorithm:  for the number in the range:
                print
'''

# for _ in range (1, 100):
#     if _ % 2 == 0:
#         print (_)

for _ in range (2, 100, 2):
    print(_)
