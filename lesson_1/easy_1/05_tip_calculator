Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill
amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip,
then print both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

You can ignore input validation and assume that
the user will enter valid numbers.

Problem:    Ask the user for the bill amount and tip rate (%)
            and tell them the tip, and the total bill
            Input - from user, assume valid (float)
            Output - either tip and total on separate lines, or consider
                    f-string
            Requirements:
                No data validation necessary
                Output should be rounded to 2dp
            START
            GET/SET bill amount
            GET/SET tip percentage
            Operate on inputs
            PRINT outputs
            END

Examples:   Sub-total = £100.00, tip rate = 12.5%
            Tip = £12.50, Total = £112.50

Data:       input() to get the 2 pieces of data
            * and + operators to get the outputs
            print to output to the user

Algorithm:  Ask for inputs x2
            SET sub_total = input_1
            SET tip_percentage = input_2
            SET tip = tip_percentage/100 * sub_total
            SET total = sub_total + tip
            PRINT total
            PRINT tip

'''

sub_total = float(input('What is the bill? '))
tip_percentage = float(input('What is the tip percentage? '))

tip = (tip_percentage/100 * sub_total)
total = sub_total + tip

print(f'The tip is £{tip:.2f}')
print(f'The total is £{total:.2f}')
