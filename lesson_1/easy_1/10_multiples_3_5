Write a function that computes the sum of all numbers between 1 and
some other number, inclusive, that are multiples of 3 or 5.
For instance, if the supplied number is 20, the result should be 98
(3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).

You may assume that the number passed in is an integer greater than 1.

Problem:    Determine the numbers that are factors of 3 or 5
            Sum these numbers and return the output
        
Examples:   These examples should all print True:
       
            print(multisum(3) == 3)
            print(multisum(5) == 8)
            print(multisum(10) == 33)
            print(multisum(1000) == 234168)
            

Data:       Assume number is valid (int and > 1)
            List to store multiples
            Range to iterate through numbers
            % to determine factors
            If to determine factors
            Append to list if a factor
            Ternary to produce the output

Algorithm:  START
            SET multiples as a list of numbers
            FOR number in range:
                IF number % 3 == 0
                    append
                ELIF number % 5 == 0
                    append
            SUM FOR number in list
            END
